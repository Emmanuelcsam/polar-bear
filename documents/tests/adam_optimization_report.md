# Adam Optimization Implementation Report

## Overview
Successfully implemented advanced Adam optimization variants and integrated them into the Fiber Optics Neural Network system.

## Implemented Features

### 1. Advanced Adam Optimizer (`fiber_hybrid_optimizer.py`)
- **Standard Adam**: Adaptive learning rate optimization
- **AdamW**: Decoupled weight decay for better regularization
- **NAdam**: Nesterov-accelerated Adam for improved convergence

- **Gradient Clipping**: Prevents gradient explosion

### 2. Hybrid Adam-SAM Optimizer
Combines the benefits of:
- **Adam variants**: Adaptive learning rates
- **SAM (Sharpness-Aware Minimization)**: Finds flatter minima for better generalization
- Supports all Adam variants within the SAM framework

### 3. Learning Rate Scheduling
- **AdamWarmupCosineScheduler**: Linear warmup followed by cosine annealing
- Supports per-parameter group learning rates
- Configurable warmup steps and minimum learning rate

### 4. Configuration Integration

- Parameter groups with different learning rates for:
  - Feature extraction layers
  - Segmentation layers
  - Reference embeddings
  - Decoder layers
  - Equation parameters

# Training loop
for epoch in range(num_epochs):
    for batch in dataloader:
        # Forward pass
        outputs = model(batch['images'])
        loss = criterion(outputs, batch['labels'])
        
        # Backward pass
        loss.backward()
        
        # Optimizer step (for SAM variants, requires closure)
        if isinstance(optimizer, HybridAdamSAM):
            def closure():
                optimizer.zero_grad()
                outputs = model(batch['images'])
                loss = criterion(outputs, batch['labels'])
                loss.backward()
                return loss
            optimizer.step(closure)
        else:
            optimizer.step()
