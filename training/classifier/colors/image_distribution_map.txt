TOTAL IMAGES DISTRIBUTED: 89 files
=====================================

COLOR-BASED DISTRIBUTION STRATEGY
=================================
The images were distributed based on color correlations with fiber optic connector conditions:
- Clean conditions: White, Lime (bright/clean appearance)
- Dirty conditions: Dark Gray, Orange (contamination appearance)
- Oil conditions: Teal, Dark Green (oil-like colors)
- Anomaly conditions: Dark Red, Orange, Pink (unusual/warning colors)
- Scratched conditions: Gray (wear appearance)
- Blob conditions: Cyan, Pink (droplet/blob appearance)
- Component categories: Gray, Dark Gray (distributed across core/cladding/ferrule)
