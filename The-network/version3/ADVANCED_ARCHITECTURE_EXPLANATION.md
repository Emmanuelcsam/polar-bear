# Advanced Integrated Neural Network Architecture

## Overview

This advanced implementation creates a neural network where **every feature is simultaneously analyzed for both classification AND anomaly detection** at multiple scales, with all processing happening within the network layers.

## Key Innovation: Simultaneous Feature Analysis

### The Core Concept

Instead of:
1. Extract features → Classify → Reconstruct → Find anomalies

We do:
1. Extract features AND simultaneously:
   - Compare to normal patterns (for classification)
   - Compare to anomaly patterns (for defect detection)
   - Assess feature quality
   - All at the same time, at every scale

## Architecture Components

### 1. Multi-Scale Gradient/Position Weighted Convolutions

```python
MultiScaleGradientPositionConv
```
- Extracts features at 3 different kernel sizes (3x3, 5x5, 7x7)
- Each scale is weighted by gradient intensity and pixel position
- Weights are learned and adjusted during training
- Implements the I=Ax₁+Bx₂+... equation at each scale

### 2. Simultaneous Feature-Anomaly Blocks

```python
SimultaneousFeatureAnomalyBlock
```
This is the key innovation. For each feature:

- **Normal Pattern Matching**: Compares to learned normal patterns for core/cladding/ferrule
- **Anomaly Pattern Matching**: Simultaneously compares to learned defect patterns
- **Threshold Analysis**: If similarity to normal patterns falls below threshold, it's anomalous
- **Quality Assessment**: How well does this feature match ANY expected pattern?

All happening in parallel, not sequentially!

### 3. Cross-Scale Correlation

Features from different scales are correlated to ensure consistency:
- Small defects visible at fine scales
- Large defects visible at coarse scales
- Correlation ensures we don't miss anything

### 4. Trend Analysis Integration

The network learns gradient and position trends for each region:
- Core has certain expected gradient patterns
- Cladding has different patterns
- Deviations from trends indicate anomalies
- But region transitions follow trends and aren't anomalies

## How It Processes an Image

```
Input Image
    ↓
[Multi-Scale Feature Extraction]
    - Scale 1: 3x3 features weighted by gradient/position
    - Scale 2: 5x5 features weighted by gradient/position  
    - Scale 3: 7x7 features weighted by gradient/position
    - Scale 4: Deeper features
    ↓
[Simultaneous Analysis at EACH Scale]
    ├─ Compare to normal patterns → Region classification
    ├─ Compare to anomaly patterns → Defect detection
    ├─ Check threshold adherence → Anomaly scores
    └─ Assess quality → Confidence scores
    ↓
[Cross-Scale Correlation]
    - Ensure consistency across scales
    - Combine multi-scale results
    ↓
[Trend Analysis]
    - Check if features follow expected trends
    - Distinguish defects from transitions
    ↓
[Global Integration]
    ├─ Final segmentation (weighted from all scales)
    ├─ Final anomaly map (combined from all scales)
    ├─ Reference matching
    └─ Reconstruction (using quality-weighted features)
    ↓
Output: Complete simultaneous analysis
```

## Key Advantages

1. **No Information Loss**: Features are analyzed for everything simultaneously
2. **Multi-Scale Redundancy**: Defects can't hide - detected at multiple scales
3. **Context-Aware**: Anomaly detection knows about region classification
4. **Adaptive**: Weights adjust based on image characteristics
5. **Comprehensive**: Every pixel analyzed for classification AND anomalies

## Training Process

The network learns to:
1. Extract meaningful features at multiple scales
2. Recognize normal patterns for each region
3. Recognize anomaly patterns (scratches, contamination, etc.)
4. Learn gradient/position trends for regions
5. Correlate information across scales
6. All simultaneously in one end-to-end system

## Example Processing

For a fiber image with a scratch:

**Scale 1 (Fine)**: 
- Detects sharp edge of scratch
- High anomaly score along scratch
- Lower quality score in scratch area

**Scale 2 (Medium)**:
- Confirms scratch presence
- Provides context about surrounding region

**Scale 3 (Coarse)**:
- Identifies overall region (e.g., scratch is in cladding)
- Confirms it's not a region transition

**Final Result**:
- Segmentation: Correctly identifies core/cladding/ferrule
- Anomaly: Precisely locates scratch
- Quality: Shows degraded quality along scratch
- All from one forward pass!

## Usage

```bash
# Train the advanced model
python advanced_integrated_main.py train

# Analyze an image with detailed output
python advanced_integrated_main.py analyze image.jpg

# Run interactive demo
python advanced_integrated_main.py demo

# Compare approaches
python advanced_integrated_main.py compare
```

This architecture truly implements simultaneous analysis where each feature contributes to both classification and anomaly detection at the same time!
