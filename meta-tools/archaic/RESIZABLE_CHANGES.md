- Automatic layout recalculation on window resize
- Minimum size enforcement (600px width minimum, 400px height minimum)

### 4. **UI Improvements**
- Text truncation for long directory names in buttons
- Adaptive font sizing (20-40px range based on window width)
- Better button height scaling (40-80px range)
- Improved auto-button positioning with padding

### 5. **Type Safety**
- Added proper type annotations for better code reliability
- Fixed type issues with current_slots list

## Key Features

### Resizable Window
- Users can now manually resize the window by dragging corners/edges
- Window maintains functionality at all supported sizes
- Minimum size constraints prevent UI from becoming unusable

### Adaptive UI Elements
- Font size scales with window size
- Button dimensions adjust to window size
- Auto-button positioning adapts to window size
- Image display area scales proportionally

### Maintained Functionality
- All original features work at any window size
- Keyboard shortcuts remain functional
- Mouse interaction adapts to new button positions
- Auto-mode continues to work properly

## Usage Instructions

1. **Manual Resizing**: Drag window edges or corners to resize
2. **Minimum Size**: Window enforces minimum usable size automatically
3. **Visual Feedback**: Window title shows current dimensions
4. **Adaptive Text**: Button text truncates automatically for long names

## Technical Details

- Window mode: `pygame.RESIZABLE`
- Minimum width: max(600px, number_of_directories * 100px)
- Minimum height: 400px
- Font scaling: 20-40px based on window width
- Button height: 40-80px based on window height

The app now provides a much more flexible user experience while maintaining all original functionality.
