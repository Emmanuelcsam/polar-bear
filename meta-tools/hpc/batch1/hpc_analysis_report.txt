HPC CAPABILITY ANALYSIS - POLAR BEAR FIBER OPTICS NEURAL NETWORK
================================================================

PROGRAM OVERVIEW:
-----------------
This is a PyTorch-based computer vision system for analyzing fiber optic cable end-faces, detecting defects (scratches, contamination, chips, cracks), and performing quality assessment. It uses advanced CNN architectures with attention mechanisms, deformable convolutions, and multi-scale feature extraction.

HPC CAPABILITY STATUS:
----------------------
**PARTIALLY CAPABLE** - The program has HPC configuration settings but lacks actual distributed training implementation.

CURRENT HPC-READY FEATURES:
---------------------------
1. Single GPU support with CUDA acceleration
2. Mixed precision training (AMP) for faster computation
3. Multi-worker data loading (16-32 workers configured)
4. Gradient accumulation (4 steps) for larger effective batch sizes
5. Memory-efficient operations (gradient checkpointing, optimized attention)
6. Batch processing support
7. Configuration for distributed training (but not implemented):
   - use_distributed: true
   - distributed_backend: "nccl"
   - world_size: 8
   - rank: 0

MISSING HPC COMPONENTS:
-----------------------
1. No torch.distributed implementation
2. No DistributedDataParallel (DDP) wrapper
3. No process group initialization
4. No distributed data sampler
5. No SLURM job scripts (previously existed but were deleted)
6. No multi-node communication setup
7. No gradient synchronization across nodes

HOW IT WOULD RUN ON W&M BORA HPC:
----------------------------------

SINGLE NODE EXECUTION (CURRENTLY POSSIBLE):
1. Request GPU node: #SBATCH --partition=gpu --gres=gpu:1
2. Load modules: module load python/3.x cuda/11.x
3. Install dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt
4. Run: python main.py --mode train --config config.yaml
5. Will utilize single GPU with full CUDA acceleration
6. Can leverage up to 128GB RAM per node for large batch sizes
7. Will use NVMe scratch space for fast I/O

MULTI-NODE EXECUTION (REQUIRES IMPLEMENTATION):
To properly run distributed training on Bora:

1. SLURM Script Requirements:
   ```bash
   #!/bin/bash
   #SBATCH --job-name=polar-bear-distributed
   #SBATCH --partition=gpu
   #SBATCH --nodes=4
   #SBATCH --ntasks-per-node=2
   #SBATCH --gres=gpu:2
   #SBATCH --cpus-per-task=8
   #SBATCH --mem=128G
   #SBATCH --time=24:00:00
   
   module load python cuda openmpi
   
   export MASTER_ADDR=$(scontrol show hostname $SLURM_JOB_NODELIST | head -n 1)
   export MASTER_PORT=29500
   export WORLD_SIZE=$SLURM_NTASKS
   
   srun python main.py --distributed
   ```

2. Code Modifications Needed:
   - Wrap model in DistributedDataParallel:
     ```python
     model = torch.nn.parallel.DistributedDataParallel(model, device_ids=[local_rank])
     ```
   - Initialize process group:
     ```python
     torch.distributed.init_process_group(backend='nccl', init_method='env://')
     ```
   - Use DistributedSampler for data loading:
     ```python
     sampler = torch.utils.data.distributed.DistributedSampler(dataset)
     ```
   - Synchronize gradients and metrics across nodes

3. Performance Expectations on Bora:
   - Single V100 GPU: ~100-200 images/second
   - 4 nodes with 8 V100s: ~800-1600 images/second (with proper scaling)
   - Memory bandwidth: 900 GB/s per GPU
   - Inter-node communication: InfiniBand for fast gradient synchronization
   - NVLink between GPUs on same node for efficient data sharing

4. Optimizations for Bora Architecture:
   - Use NCCL for GPU communication (already configured)
   - Leverage NVMe scratch for dataset staging
   - Pin memory for faster CPU-GPU transfers
   - Use gradient accumulation to maximize GPU utilization
   - Enable mixed precision (already configured) for 2x speedup

DATA HANDLING ON HPC:
---------------------
1. Stage dataset to /scratch/$USER/ for fast I/O
2. Use parallel data loading with workers = 2 * num_gpus
3. Implement data sharding across nodes
4. Cache preprocessed data in shared memory if possible

SCALABILITY ANALYSIS:
---------------------
- Strong Scaling: Limited by batch size and model architecture
- Weak Scaling: Good potential with larger datasets
- Communication Overhead: Significant for small batches
- Optimal Configuration: 4-8 nodes with 2 GPUs each
- Expected Efficiency: 70-85% with proper implementation

RECOMMENDATIONS FOR HPC DEPLOYMENT:
-----------------------------------
1. Implement distributed training wrapper
2. Create comprehensive SLURM scripts for different job sizes
3. Add checkpointing for long-running jobs
4. Implement dynamic batching for GPU utilization
5. Add performance monitoring (GPU utilization, communication time)
6. Use Horovod or PyTorch Lightning for easier distributed implementation
7. Profile with nvprof to identify bottlenecks
8. Consider model parallelism for very large models

CURRENT LIMITATIONS FOR HPC:
----------------------------
1. No automatic recovery from node failures
2. No elastic training support
3. Fixed batch size (not adaptive to available resources)
4. No communication compression
5. No overlapping of computation and communication

SUMMARY:
--------
The program is ARCHITECTURALLY SUITABLE for HPC but requires significant implementation work to utilize multi-node capabilities. In its current state, it will run on a single GPU node effectively but cannot scale beyond that. The existing configuration suggests HPC support was planned but not completed. With proper distributed training implementation, this program could achieve near-linear scaling on Bora's GPU nodes for training large fiber optic defect detection models.
