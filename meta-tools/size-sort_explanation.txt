SIZE-SORT.PY - IMAGE RESOLUTION ORGANIZER
==========================================

QUICK DEBRIEF (First 5 Points):
1. Sorts images into folders based on their pixel dimensions (resolution)
2. Interactive mode with yes/no prompts instead of command-line flags
3. Uses PIL (Python Imaging Library) for accurate dimension detection across formats
4. Handles various image formats with comprehensive error recovery
5. User-friendly directory selection and validation with clear progress feedback

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:
====================

PURPOSE:
--------
Efficient image organization tool that automatically categorizes images based on their resolution characteristics. Essential for photographers, web developers, and digital asset managers who need to organize large image collections by size specifications for different use cases.

KEY FEATURES:
-------------
• Resolution-Based Sorting: Organizes images by pixel dimensions (width x height)
• Interactive Interface: User-friendly prompts for all configuration options
• Format Compatibility: Supports all major image formats through PIL integration
• Automatic Organization: Creates appropriately named folders for each resolution
• Error Recovery: Graceful handling of corrupted or unsupported image files
• Progress Feedback: Clear status updates throughout the sorting process

TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION:
------------------------
• Image Analysis: PIL (Python Imaging Library) for accurate dimension detection
• Directory Management: Automatic creation of resolution-based folders
• File Operations: Safe copying/moving with duplicate handling
• Interactive Logic: Yes/no validation system for user decisions
• Error Handling: Comprehensive exception management for file operations
• Path Validation: Robust directory existence and accessibility checking

SORTING METHODOLOGY:
-------------------

1. DIMENSION DETECTION:
   - Opens each image file with PIL
   - Extracts width and height dimensions
   - Handles various image formats uniformly
   - Maintains original file format information

2. FOLDER CREATION:
   - Generates descriptive folder names based on dimensions
   - Format: "WIDTHxHEIGHT" (e.g., "1920x1080", "800x600")
   - Creates folders only when needed (on-demand creation)
   - Maintains organized directory structure

3. FILE ORGANIZATION:
   - Copies or moves images to appropriate dimension folders
   - Preserves original filenames within organized structure
   - Handles naming conflicts intelligently
   - Maintains file integrity throughout process

INTERACTIVE WORKFLOW:
--------------------
1. Directory Selection: User chooses source directory containing images
2. Operation Mode: User selects copy vs. move operation
3. Confirmation: User reviews settings before processing begins
4. Processing: Automatic sorting with real-time progress updates
5. Completion: Summary report of organization results

INPUT/OUTPUT:
-------------
• Input: Directory containing mixed-resolution images
• Output: Organized subdirectories named by resolution
• Structure: Resolution-based folders (e.g., 1920x1080/, 800x600/)
• Preservation: Original files maintained or safely moved
• Reports: Summary statistics of organization results

SUPPORTED IMAGE FORMATS:
------------------------
Through PIL integration, supports:
• JPEG/JPG: Most common web and camera formats
• PNG: Lossless format with transparency
• BMP: Uncompressed bitmap format
• TIFF: High-quality format for professional use
• GIF: Animated and static graphics format
• WEBP: Modern web-optimized format
• Additional: Any format supported by PIL

USER INTERACTION SYSTEM:
------------------------
• Yes/No Prompts: Simple binary choice validation
• Default Values: Sensible defaults with clear indication
• Input Validation: Ensures user responses are understood correctly
• Error Recovery: Re-prompts for invalid responses
• Clear Instructions: Helpful guidance for each decision point

DEPENDENCIES:
-------------
• Image Processing: PIL (Python Imaging Library/Pillow)
• File Operations: os, shutil for directory and file management
• Path Handling: pathlib for cross-platform compatibility
• User Interface: Built-in input() for interactive prompts

USE CASES:
----------
• Web Development: Organize images by resolution for responsive design
• Photography: Sort photos by camera resolution or output size
• Asset Management: Organize design assets by dimension requirements
• Archive Organization: Systematically organize historical image collections
• Workflow Preparation: Prepare images for resolution-specific processing
• Quality Control: Identify and separate images by quality/resolution tiers

PERFORMANCE CHARACTERISTICS:
---------------------------
• Processing Speed: ~50-200 images per minute (depending on file sizes)
• Memory Usage: Minimal - opens images only for dimension reading
• Accuracy: High precision through PIL's reliable format handling
• Scalability: Handles collections from dozens to thousands of images
• Efficiency: Quick dimension detection without full image loading

ORGANIZATION BENEFITS:
---------------------
• Clear Structure: Intuitive folder naming makes finding specific resolutions easy
• Workflow Optimization: Enables resolution-specific batch processing
• Storage Efficiency: Groups similar-sized images for efficient storage planning
• Quality Assessment: Easy identification of resolution distribution in collections
• Batch Processing: Facilitates resolution-specific operations on organized groups

ADVANCED FEATURES:
-----------------
• Duplicate Handling: Intelligent management of files with identical names
• Large Collection Support: Efficient processing of extensive image libraries
• Cross-Platform Compatibility: Works reliably on Windows, macOS, and Linux
• Unicode Support: Handles international filenames correctly
• Recovery Options: Maintains organization integrity despite individual file failures

ERROR HANDLING CATEGORIES:
-------------------------
• File Access: Graceful handling of locked or permission-restricted files
• Format Issues: Continues processing despite corrupted or unsupported files
• Disk Space: Manages insufficient space issues during organization
• Path Problems: Handles complex path scenarios and naming conflicts
• Interruption Recovery: Maintains partial organization if process is interrupted

CONFIGURATION OPTIONS:
---------------------
• Source Directory: Configurable input directory selection
• Operation Mode: Choice between copy and move operations
• Naming Convention: Customizable folder naming patterns
• File Filtering: Optional filtering by specific image formats
• Conflict Resolution: Configurable duplicate handling strategies

PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS:
----------------------
• Responsive Web Design: Organize images for different screen resolutions
• Print Production: Separate images by print resolution requirements
• Mobile App Development: Organize assets for different device densities
• E-commerce: Organize product images by display size requirements
• Digital Marketing: Organize images for different platform specifications

INTEGRATION POTENTIAL:
---------------------
• Workflow Automation: Can be part of larger image processing pipelines
