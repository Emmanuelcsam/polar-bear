DETAILED DESCRIPTION:
====================

PURPOSE:
--------
Professional-grade image duplicate detection system that goes beyond filename comparison to identify visually identical or nearly identical images. Designed for photographers, digital asset managers, and anyone dealing with large image collections where duplicates may have different names or slight variations.

KEY FEATURES:
-------------
• Visual Content Analysis: Detects duplicates based on actual image content, not filenames
• Multiple Detection Methods: Combines exact matching, perceptual hashing, and color analysis
• Format Agnostic: Identifies duplicates across different image formats (JPEG, PNG, etc.)
• Similarity Thresholds: Configurable sensitivity for near-duplicate detection
• Visual Preview: Optional preview mode for manual verification of duplicates
• Comprehensive Reporting: Detailed analysis with similarity scores and recommendations

DETECTION METHODS:
-----------------

1. EXACT MATCH DETECTION:
   - Byte-for-byte comparison using SHA-256 hashing
   - 100% accurate for identical images regardless of filename
   - Fastest method for detecting perfect duplicates
   - Handles different formats of the same image

2. PERCEPTUAL HASH ANALYSIS:
   - Uses imagehash library for robust perceptual fingerprinting
   - Detects images that look identical to human perception
   - Tolerant of minor compression differences
   - Handles slight quality variations and format conversions

3. COLOR HISTOGRAM COMPARISON:
   - Analyzes color distribution patterns
   - Detects images with similar color compositions
   - Useful for identifying related images and variations
   - Configurable similarity thresholds for different use cases

---------
1. Automatic dependency verification and installation
2. Interactive configuration of detection parameters
3. Comprehensive directory scanning for all image formats
4. Multi-method analysis: exact, perceptual, and color-based detection
5. Similarity scoring and threshold application
6. Optional visual preview for manual verification
7. Safe removal or organization with detailed logging
