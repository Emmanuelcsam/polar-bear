DETAILED DESCRIPTION:
====================

PURPOSE:
--------
Professional-grade duplicate file management tool designed for safely cleaning up large file collections. Uses cryptographic hashing to ensure 100% accuracy in duplicate detection while providing comprehensive safety mechanisms and detailed reporting.

KEY FEATURES:
-------------
• Cryptographic Accuracy: SHA-256 content hashing ensures perfect duplicate detection
• Safety First: Trash folder option allows complete recovery of deleted files
• Interactive Mode: No command-line arguments - guided interactive operation
• Auto-Dependencies: Automatically installs required packages if missing
• Progress Tracking: Real-time progress bars and detailed status updates
• Comprehensive Logging: Timestamped logs with multiple severity levels
• Space Analysis: Detailed reporting of storage space reclaimed

SAFETY MECHANISMS:
-----------------
• Trash Folder Option: Moves duplicates to recoverable trash directory
• Interactive Confirmation: User approval required before any deletions
• Detailed Logging: Complete audit trail of all operations
• File Verification: Double-checks file accessibility before processing
• Error Recovery: Graceful handling of permission issues and file locks
• Backup Information: Preserves original file locations and metadata

TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION:
------------------------
• Hash Algorithm: SHA-256 for cryptographically secure content comparison
• Memory Efficiency: Processes files in chunks to handle large files
• Progress Monitoring: tqdm integration for real-time progress visualization
• Color Output: colorama for enhanced terminal readability
• Error Handling: Comprehensive exception management with detailed logging
• Cross-Platform: Works on Windows, macOS, and Linux systems

DEPENDENCY MANAGEMENT:
---------------------
The tool includes an intelligent dependency manager that:
• Automatically detects missing packages
• Installs required dependencies via pip
• Provides clear installation progress feedback
• Handles installation failures gracefully
• Required packages: tqdm (progress bars), colorama (colored output)

DUPLICATE DETECTION PROCESS:
---------------------------
1. Directory Traversal: Recursively scans all subdirectories
2. File Filtering: Identifies regular files and checks accessibility
3. Content Hashing: Calculates SHA-256 hash for each file
4. Duplicate Grouping: Groups files by identical hash values
5. Selection Logic: Keeps first occurrence, marks others as duplicates
6. User Confirmation: Interactive review of duplicates found
7. Safe Removal: Moves or deletes duplicates with full logging

WORKFLOW:
---------
1. Interactive directory selection and safety option configuration
2. Dependency verification and automatic installation if needed
3. Comprehensive directory scanning with progress tracking
4. Content-based duplicate analysis using SHA-256 hashing
5. Interactive presentation of duplicate groups for user review
6. Safe removal process with trash folder option
7. Detailed reporting of space saved and operations performed

INPUT/OUTPUT:
-------------
• Input: Directory path for duplicate scanning (interactive selection)
• Output: Cleaned directory structure with duplicates removed or moved
• Logging: Comprehensive log files with timestamped operations
• Reports: Detailed statistics on duplicates found and space reclaimed
• Trash Folder: Optional recovery directory for moved duplicates

SAFETY OPTIONS:
--------------
• Trash Folder Mode: Moves duplicates to recoverable trash directory
• Direct Deletion Mode: Permanently removes duplicates (with confirmation)
• Dry Run Option: Preview operations without making changes
• Interactive Confirmation: User approval for each duplicate group
• Detailed Logging: Complete audit trail for accountability

PERFORMANCE CHARACTERISTICS:
---------------------------
• Hashing Speed: ~50-200 MB/s (depends on storage speed)
• Memory Usage: Minimal - processes files individually
• Accuracy: 100% - cryptographic hashing eliminates false positives
• Scalability: Handles directories with thousands of files
• Progress Feedback: Real-time updates on processing status

DEPENDENCIES:
-------------
• Core: hashlib (SHA-256), pathlib, logging, datetime
• Enhanced UX: tqdm (progress bars), colorama (colored output)
• System: os, sys, shutil for file operations
• Auto-Installation: subprocess, importlib.util for dependency management
• Data Structures: collections.defaultdict for efficient duplicate grouping

USE CASES:
----------
• Storage Cleanup: Reclaim disk space by removing duplicate files
• Backup Deduplication: Clean up redundant backup files
• Download Folder Management: Remove duplicate downloads
• Photo Collection Cleanup: Eliminate duplicate photos and images
• Document Management: Clean up duplicate office documents
• Archive Maintenance: Deduplicate archived file collections

LOGGING CAPABILITIES:
--------------------
• Timestamped Entries: Precise tracking of all operations
• Multiple Severity Levels: INFO, WARNING, ERROR for different events
• File Operations: Detailed logging of moves, deletions, and errors
• Statistics Tracking: Counts of files processed, duplicates found, space saved
• Error Documentation: Comprehensive error reporting for troubleshooting

INTERACTIVE FEATURES:
--------------------
• Directory Selection: User-friendly path input with validation
• Safety Configuration: Choice between trash folder and direct deletion
• Progress Visualization: Real-time progress bars with time estimates
• Duplicate Review: Option to review duplicate groups before action
• Confirmation Prompts: Safety confirmations for destructive operations

RECOVERY MECHANISMS:
-------------------
• Trash Folder: Complete directory structure preservation
• Detailed Logs: Information needed to manually reverse operations
• File Metadata: Preservation of original timestamps and permissions
• Location Tracking: Original file paths recorded for recovery
• Verification: Post-operation checks to ensure data integrity

ADVANCED FEATURES:
-----------------
• Large File Support: Efficient handling of multi-gigabyte files
