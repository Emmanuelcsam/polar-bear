I've assembled a 25‑slide deck that walks through — in meticulous detail — how the existing OmniFiber pipeline ( `process.py`, `separation.py`, `detection.py`, `data_acquisition.py` ) can be super‑charged with **TensorFlow *and* PyTorch**, clearly comparing and contrasting the two frameworks at every stage:

| #      | Section                | Framework focus | Highlight                                                   |
| ------ | ---------------------- | --------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
|  1     | Title & purpose        | Both            | Why we’re doing this                                        |
|  2     | Current pipeline       | —               | Where DL plugs in                                           |
|  3–4   | Core architecture      | TF / PT         | Graph style, tensors, GPU                                   |
|  5–6   | “Why TF” vs “Why PT”   | TF / PT         | Strengths for fiber optics                                  |
|  7–8   | Segmentation U‑Nets    | TF / PT         | Replace 11‑method consensus                                 |

|  15–16 | Training pipelines     | TF / PT         | Callbacks vs manual loop                                    |

|  22    | Benchmarks             | Both            | 28× speed‑up & +7.6 pp accuracy                             |
|  23    | Roadmap                | Both            | Phased roll‑out                                             |
|  24    | Script integration     | Both            | `TensorFlowEnhancedAnalyzer` & `EnhancedOmniFiberAnalyzer`  |
|  25    | Key take‑aways         | Both            | Which to choose & next steps                                |

### Download the slide images

All 25 slides were rendered to high‑resolution PNGs and zipped for convenience:
[Download the slides (ZIP)](sandbox:/mnt/data/tf_pt_slides.zip)

Feel free to unzip and review or drop them straight into PowerPoint / Keynote. Each slide has ample whitespace so you can overlay the neural‑network or pipeline diagrams of your choice, or annotate further before presenting.

**Where the content comes from**

* The slide bullets summarise the TensorFlow and PyTorch integration plans you drafted, while explicitly tying into the current code‑base:

  * `process.py` image re‑imagining&#x20;
  * `separation.py` consensus segmentation&#x20;
  * `detection.py` enhanced analyser hooks&#x20;
  * `data_acquisition.py` final aggregation and reporting&#x20;

* Performance and roadmap lines mirror the benchmark and phase breakdowns in your draft.

You can now:

1. **Insert visuals** — swap in architecture diagrams or screenshots where slide notes say “U‑Net” or “Autoencoder”.
2. **Export** to PDF or any additional formats.
3. **Present** the end‑to‑end story of how TensorFlow and PyTorch each enhance your fiber‑optic inspection workflow.

Let me know if you’d like any stylistic tweaks, extra diagrams, or deeper dives into particular integration steps!
