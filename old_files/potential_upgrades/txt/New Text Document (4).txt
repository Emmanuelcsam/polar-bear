If you want to run your project on **Arduino** and **Raspberry Pi 5**, here's the best path forward:

---

### üß† **Key Differences in Target Hardware**

| Platform           | Capabilities                                 |
| ------------------ | -------------------------------------------- |
| **Arduino**        | Very limited (no OS, low RAM/CPU)            |
| **Raspberry Pi 5** | Full Linux OS, up to 8GB RAM, decent CPU/GPU |

### üîå **Short Answer**

* **Arduino**: ‚ùå *Not suitable for your current project* ‚Äî too limited for image processing or ML.
* **Raspberry Pi 5**: ‚úÖ *Works well*, but:

  * **Use TensorFlow Lite** or **ONNX Runtime** for efficient inference.
  * Rewrite parts of your project to use **edge-friendly models**.
  * Consider using **PyTorch Mobile** or **TorchScript**, but PyTorch isn't officially optimized for Pi.

### üîß **What You Should Do**

#### ‚úÖ For Raspberry Pi 5:

1. **Convert or retrain any heavy models** using:

   * **TensorFlow Lite** (preferred for edge devices).
   * Or **ONNX + OpenCV** for model inference.

2. **Rewrite core logic for efficiency:**

   * Reduce use of heavy OpenCV operations.
   * Use integer quantization in ML models.

3. **Use lightweight libraries:**

   * Replace Matplotlib with `pygame` or omit plots entirely.
   * Avoid pandas or other desktop-heavy tools.

#### ‚ùå For Arduino:

* Best used as a sensor controller or trigger device.
* Let Arduino capture input (e.g. IR or buttons), send data to Raspberry Pi over serial/I2C.
* Offload all image processing and inference to the Pi.

---

### üèÅ TL;DR

* **Raspberry Pi 5**: Use **TensorFlow Lite** or **ONNX**, rewrite for speed.
* **Arduino**: Use only for triggering or sensors ‚Äî no heavy compute.
* **PyTorch**: Great for training, not ideal for deployment on these platforms.
