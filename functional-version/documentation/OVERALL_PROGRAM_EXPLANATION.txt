COMPREHENSIVE FIBER OPTIC DEFECT DETECTION SYSTEM - OVERALL PROGRAM EXPLANATION
===============================================================================

SYSTEM OVERVIEW:
================

This is a sophisticated, multi-stage computer vision system designed to automatically detect and classify defects in fiber optic cable end-faces. The system uses a pipeline architecture with four main stages, each building upon the results of the previous stage to achieve highly accurate defect detection and quality assessment.

The system is designed to handle the unique challenges of fiber optic inspection:
- Very small defect sizes (micrometers scale)
- Multiple material regions with different properties
- Various defect types (scratches, pits, contamination, etc.)
- Varying image quality and lighting conditions

ARCHITECTURE:
=============

The system follows a 4-stage pipeline architecture:

```
Input Image → Stage 1 (Process) → Stage 2 (Separation) → Stage 3 (Detection) → Stage 4 (Data Acquisition) → Final Report
```

Each stage is modular and can be updated independently, making the system maintainable and extensible.

STAGE 1: IMAGE PROCESSING (process.py)

   - Stage 4: Generate final masks from averaged parameters

3. **Learning System**:
   - Tracks method performance over time
   - Updates scores using exponential moving average
   - Weights future consensus by historical accuracy

Mathematical Concepts:
- Intersection over Union (IoU): |A ∩ B| / |A ∪ B|

   - Local: Sliding window anomaly detection
   - Specific: Targeted detectors for scratches, pits, blobs

4. **Defect Classification**:
   - Types: SCRATCH, DIG, PIT, CONTAMINATION, CHIP, etc.
   - Severity: CRITICAL, HIGH, MEDIUM, LOW, NEGLIGIBLE
   - Based on confidence scores and thresholds

Mathematical Foundation:
