# Defect Detector Visualization Outputs

## Overview
The defect detector creates multiple visualization outputs at different stages of the pipeline. All visualizations ARE being created properly and show detected defects clearly.

## Visualization Files Created

### 1. Detection Stage (`detection.py`)
Located in: `<output_dir>/detection/`

- **`img63_analysis.png`** (1 MB) - Comprehensive 12-panel analysis showing:
  - Original test image
  - Reference archetype
  - Difference map
  - SSIM map
  - Anomaly heatmap
  - Local anomaly regions
  - Feature deviation plots
  - Structural analysis
  - Specific defects overlay
  - Binary defect mask
  - Quality metrics
  - Feature statistics

- **`img63_analysis_simple.png`** (865 KB) - Simple overlay with all defects highlighted in BLUE:
  - Blue rectangles around anomaly regions
  - Blue lines for scratches
  - Blue circles for digs/pits
  - Semi-transparent blue fill for visibility

- **`img63_defect_mask.npy`** (995 KB) - Binary numpy array mask of defect locations

### 2. Data Acquisition Stage (`data_acquisition.py`)
Located in: `<output_dir>/4_final_analysis/`

- **`img63_comprehensive_analysis.png`** (2.3 MB) - Multi-panel comprehensive view:
  - Original image with color-coded defect overlay
  - Defect heatmap
  - Type distribution chart
  - Severity distribution chart
  - Regional distribution
  - Size distribution histogram
  - Confidence scores
  - Clustering visualization
  - Quality metrics panel
  - Legend with defect counts

### 3. Separation Stage (`separation.py`)
Located in: `<output_dir>/separation/`

- **`summary_analysis.png`** - Shows fiber zones (core, cladding, ferrule)
- **`detected_defects.png`** - Defects found during anomaly detection
- **`mask_*.png`** - Binary masks for each zone
- **`region_*.png`** - Extracted region images

## Key Findings

### Visualizations ARE Working Properly
- Detection creates 2 PNG files showing defects clearly
- Data acquisition creates comprehensive multi-panel analysis
- 72 defects detected in img63.jpg
- 10,180 blue pixels in detection overlay (confirms defects are drawn)
- All defects are properly annotated with IDs and bounding boxes

### Information Preservation
Data acquisition is NOT removing process information:
- All 72 raw defects are preserved
- Clustering reduces to 23 merged defects (68.1% reduction)
- All defect metadata is maintained (type, location, severity, confidence)
- Statistics are comprehensive (by type, severity, source, size)

## Custom Visualizations Created

### For Clear Defect Display
Created `create_final_visualization.py` which generates:

1. **`final_defect_visualization.png`** - Side-by-side comparison:
   - Left: Original image
   - Right: Annotated with all 72 defects
   - Color-coded by type (red=scratch, blue=dig, yellow=contamination)
   - Bounding boxes and defect IDs
   - Legend with counts
   - Quality score summary

2. **`final_defect_visualization_opencv.png`** - OpenCV overlay:
   - Colored rectangles on original image
   - Defect labels directly on image

3. **`final_aggregated_visualization.png`** - Merged defects view:
   - Shows 23 clustered defects
   - Size indicates defect area
   - Color indicates severity
   - Statistics panel
   - Severity distribution chart

## Usage

To generate all visualizations for an image:

```python
# Run the full pipeline
from app import PipelineOrchestrator
orchestrator = PipelineOrchestrator('config.json')
results = orchestrator.run_full_pipeline('your_image.jpg')

# Or run individual stages
from detection import OmniFiberAnalyzer, OmniConfig
analyzer = OmniFiberAnalyzer(OmniConfig(enable_visualization=True))
analyzer.analyze_end_face('your_image.jpg', 'output_dir')

# Create custom visualization
python create_final_visualization.py
```

## Conclusion
All visualization outputs are working correctly. The system creates comprehensive visual reports at each stage showing:
- All detected defects with clear annotations
- Statistical analysis and quality metrics
- Multi-level views from raw detections to merged defects
- Both technical (multi-panel) and simple (overlay) visualizations

The data acquisition stage preserves all information while providing intelligent clustering to reduce duplicate detections.
