[Page 2] 113SHARE- CROPPING BLACKNESS WHITE SUPREMACY AND THE HYPER- CONSUMPTION OF B LACK POPULAR CULTURE Nyambura Njee Dyann Logwood, Mentor ABSTRACT This qualitative study will explore the impact of the way that Blackness is constructed and commodified for consumption within a White supremacist culture, and examine the effects of this construct on the Black community. According to Leonard and King (2012), in their book Commodified and Criminalized New Racism and African Americans in Contemporary Sports, The process of commodification is not simply about selling an essentialized Black culture, but rather a particular construction of Blackness that has proven beneficial to White[s] (p. 10). This paper will discuss some of the twenty-first century consequences of this phenomenon. The methodology will be conducted through a literature review and a content analysis of various cultural texts including films, interviews, and art that depict Blackness. My belief is that the popular consumption of commodified Black images is related to the maintenance of White supremacy, and thus the systemic oppression of Blacks in the United States. INTRODUCTION New racism, although articulating dominant White narrative and stereotypes, is equally defined by the consumption and celebration of commodified Blackness. Leonard King, 2012, p. 8 [Page 3] 114Color-blind and post-racial rhetoric and ideology underpin the notion that the voracious consumption of Black popular culture is a testament to the acceptance of Black people. This qualitative study will explore the process and the impact of the ways that Blackness is constructed and commodified for consumption within a white supremacist culture, and examine the effect of this construct on the Black community. As consumption of Black popular culture remains popular in the United States, Black people lose their lives daily to systematic anti-blackness. These two seemingly unrelated phenomena should be best understood as interconnected facets of contemporary White Supremacy.

...disproportionately in racially segregated cities minority neighborhoods. Plunder in the past made plunder in the present efficient. The banks of America understood this. In 2005, Wells Fargo promoted a series of Wealth Building Strategies seminars. Dubbing itself the nations leading originator of home loans to ethnic minority customers, the bank enrolled black public figures in an ostensible effort to educate blacks on building generational wealth. But the wealth building seminars were a front for wealth theft. In 2010, the Justice Department filed a discrimination suit against Wells Fargo alleging that the bank had shunted blacks into predatory loans regardless of their creditworthiness. This was not magic or coincidence or misfortune. It was racism reifying itself. According to The New York Times, affidavits found loan officers referring to their black customers as mud people and to their subprime products as ghetto loans. We just went right after them, Beth Jacobson, a former Wells Fargo loan officer, told The Times. Wells Fargo mortgage had an emerging-markets unit that specifically targeted black churches because it figured church leaders had a lot of influence.and could convince congregants to take out subprime loans. In 2011, Bank of America agreed to pay 355 million to settle charges of discrimination against its Countrywide unit. The following year, Wells Fargo settled its discrimination suit for more than 175 million. But the damage had been done. In 2009, half the properties in Baltimore whose owners had been granted loans by Wells Fargo between 2005 and 2008 were vacant 71 percent of these properties were in predominantly black neighborhoods.

[Page 1] 4 The standard language myth I therefore claim to show, not how men think in myths, but how myths operate in mens minds without their being aware of the fact. Lévi-Strauss (1964) It should be clear by now why linguists consider the idea of a spoken standardized language to be a hypothetical construct. In his survey of the evolution of the concept of a standard, Crowley (2003) uses the term idealized language, which captures the sense of an honorable and rightful perfection. Not much has changed since Jonathan Swift wrote his A proposal for correcting, improving and ascertaining the English tongue (1712). Those who take it upon themselves to protect English from its speakers are still quite sure of their right to do so. James Kilpatrick is a modern-day example of someone who brings tremendous emotion and more than a little melodrama to what he clearly sees as a battle for the one true English The lexicographers job is to distill the grapes of usage at the different levels. Thus, he doesnt go there anymore conveys the same information that is transmitted by he dont go there no more, but the one is standard American English and the other is not. Is the one inferior to the other? Of course. Who says so? This is the silent, common judgment of writers, editors, teachers and prescriptive lexicographers. The setting of standards in language is a contentious business, but somebody has to do it. Without standards, without definitions, without structural law, we lapse into linguistic anarchy. (Kilpatrick 1999) Google searches provide a sense of how large these issues loom in the minds of people more generally (Table 4.1). A survey of discussions on the topic of grammar brings up .d e vre hundreds of examples. A large portion of them have not to do with grammar in the way se it has been defined here, but with matters of punctuation. No matter the topic, the tone r sth can be affronted, sarcastic, condescending, servile and, on occasion, silly to the point of g ir llA absurdity as in an unattributed adaptation of a Nazi poster originally designed for posting .p in Holland (Figure 4.1). u o rG sicn a Table 4.1 Number of Google hits for grammar terms rF ro Google term search No. hits early October 2009 lya T .1 bad grammar 8,410,000 1 0 2 grammar advice 6,630,000 th English grammar errors 5,050,000 g iryp o C Lippi-Green, Rosina.

3. [Page 18] Oaklands Ebonics Resolutions 43 Again, Oakland had declared Ebonics to be a language other than English, whereas the LSA stated that Ebonics is identical to African American vernacular English.

4. The former includes Ebonics within the English speech community the latter ex- cludes Ebonics from the English language.

5. There he defined Ebonics in the Pan-African tradition of W. E. B.

6. Therefore, the native language of African-American people is not English.

7. Some Ebonics advocates have reaffirmed the international founda- tions of the term Ebonics in the United States, Ebonics in Haiti, Ebon- ics in Brazil, and Ebonics in Africa should not be equated with a single [Page 9] 22 Beyond Ebonics language.

8. It is Ebonics, the linguistic continuation of Africa in Black America.

9. Why would authors use black English rather than Ebonics, especially in a book that embodies the linguistic debut of Ebonics?

10. My belief that African American English is a dialect of English, and not a separate language, is based on the preceding observationnamely, the mutually exclusive forms and patterns in each (i.e., Ebonics and standard English) are educationally significant but insufficient to justify [Page 23] 48 Beyond Ebonics classification as a language other than English.

11. (Williams 1975vi) [Page 3] 16 Beyond Ebonics As this original definition indicates, Ebonics is the linguistic and para- linguistic consequence of the African slave trade.

12. To me the most significant change is the essential conces- sion that Ebonics is not merely a dialect of English, which is quite different from claims that Ebonics is not an English dialect.

13. (197577) He further asserts Ebonics is not genetically related to English, therefore, the term Ebonics is not a mere synonym for the more commonly used term Black English.

14. Also, if one concedes that Ebonics is not English, should we then make another distinction between standard Ebonics and nonstandard Ebonics, and, if so, on what basis would we determine the standard form of the language de- rived from American slavery?

Shakespeare, Romeo and Juliet I January 1973 Robert Williams hosted a conference in St. Louis titled Cognitive and Language Development of the Black Child. Two years later he published Ebonics The True Language of Black Folks. There he defined Ebonics in the Pan-African tradition of W. E. B. Du Bois. Over two decades later, Williams affirmed the international foun- dations of his linguistic creation. During testimony before the U.S. Sen- ate (see chapter 5), he stated Ebonics has two major dimensions as a language . 1. A lexicon or the vocabulary of the language, 2. Morphology or the study of the structure and form of the language that include its grammatical rules. Ebonics may be defined as the linguistic and paralinguistic features which ona concentric continuum represent the communicative competence of the West African, Carib- bean, and United States slave descendent of African origin. It includes the grammar, various idioms, patois, argots, ideolects, and social dia- lects of Black people.(Williams 1975vi) [Page 3] 16 Beyond Ebonics As this original definition indicates, Ebonics is the linguistic and para- linguistic consequence of the African slave trade. It developed in West Africa, as well as throughout the former European colonies of North and South America wherever slaves were sold into bondage. Ebonics, under this earliest definition, was never intended to apply narrowly to the United Statesand therein lies part of the confusion that has re- sulted from the Ebonics controversy. Before coining Ebonics, Williams was best known for his research on standardized IQ tests, and his long-standing critique of racial bias particularly against blacksembodied in traditional standardized norm- referenced IQ tests. He devised a series of alternative tests, including the Black Intelligence Test of Cultural Homogeneity (BITCH), which proved to be controversial for some because it intentionally inverted racial bias in favor of African Americans. Nevertheless, black children did score significantly higher on the Ebonics version than on the stan- dard English version. The following two examples show Williamss method of code switching or translation 1. Standard English Mark the toy that is behind the sofa, EBONICS Mark the toy that is in back of the couch. 2. Standard English Point to the squirrel that is beginning to climb the tree. EBONICS Point to the squirrel that is fixing to climb the tree. As Williams explains What I discovered was that, in the first example, the words [sic] be- hind and sofa were blocking agents. I translated both words to in back of and couch. In the second example, I translated the term beginning to...

...same dialect. The greater the difference between the systems, i.e., the more numerous the mu- tually exclusive forms and patterns in each, the greater is the learning problem and the potential area of interference. My belief that African American English is a dialect of English, and not a separate language, is based on the preceding observationnamely, the mutually exclusive forms and patterns in each (i.e., Ebonics and standard English) are educationally significant but insufficient to justify [Page 23] 48 Beyond Ebonics classification as a language other than English. Also, if one concedes that Ebonics is not English, should we then make another distinction between standard Ebonics and nonstandard Ebonics, and, if so, on what basis would we determine the standard form of the language de- rived from American slavery? I know of no such designation, but lan- guage educators routinely draw on such fundamental distinctions for instructional purposes. I too wish that Oakland educators had specified the need for stan- dard English proficiency rather than their more global reference to En- glish proficiency. The latter strikes me as an attempt to maintain lin- guistic and educational analogies to English language learners for whom Title VII funds are now allocated. This interpretation would, of course, conflict with assertions that the Oakland school board never intended to ask for bilingual funds, which is further complicated by Applebomes (1997b) report that Oakland officials said they expected most of the cost of the new policy to come from reallocating existing financing, but they left open the possibility of apply for Title 7 money. But the pre- liminary response from Washington balked at the proposed bilingual interpretation of Ebonics, a spokesman [sic] said Federal law specifi- cally [sic] viewed black English as a form of English, not a separate language eligible for Title VII money.

The contributors to this volume believe it is now time to chart our future by carefully learning the lessons of the recent past. This interdisciplinary collection is the first to cross traditionally restrictive disciplinary barriers to address the tough cjuestions that face the Caribbean today. WTiat went wrong with the nationalist project? Tiat, if any, are the realistic options for a more prosperous Caribbean? WTiat are to be the roles of race, gender and class in a more global, less national world? Meeks and Lindahl include thought- provoking articles from twenty-one respected thinkers in diverse disciplines. The groundbreaking articles include critiques of existing bodies of thought, reformulations of general theoretical approaches, policy-oriented alternatives for future development, and more. These articles arc essential reading, not just for academics and students of political and social theory, Caribbean studies, gender studies, posteolonial studies, Marxism and Caribbean history but for anyone interested in the state of contemporary Caribbean thought.

[Page 1] atso BY RANDALL KENNEDY NIGGER Race, Crime, and the Law The Strange Career of a Troublesome Word RANDALL KENNEDY Pantheon Books, New York [Page 2] CHAPTER THREE Pitfalls in Fighting Nigger Perils of Deception, Censoriousness, and Excessive Anger fter the Civil War, a former master approached a A former slave while she was tending livestock. What you doin, nigger? he asked, as he had probably done on many previous occasions. But this time her response was different she replied, I aint no nigger. Is a Negro and Im Miss Liza Mixon. Stung, the former master chased his former slave with a whip.! Until the civil rights revolution of the 1960s, whites in the South typically refrained from addressing blacks as Mr. or Mrs. but instead called them by their first names or by titles signifying a senior with servile y gnitying 113 [Page 3] NIGGER statustitles such as Uncle or Auntie. Addressing all black men as boys, regardless of their age, was another way for whites to observe Jim Crow etiquette. Positive modifications to such practices have been effected only through struggle. To avoid or at least mini- mize belittlement, some blacks made a habit of identify- ing themselves only by their last names. Blacks furiously objected to Negro being spelled with a lower- as opposed to an uppercase N, and on March 7, 1930, the editors of the New York Times announced that the paper would henceforth capitalize the N in Negro. The U.S. Govern- ment Printing Office followed suit three years later. Within a decade, capitalization would become the rule at the Supreme Court as well. , Referring to blacks derogatorily as niggers, however, was the custom to which blacks objected most strongly. In 1939, when David 0. Selznick was in the throes of producing Gone With the Wind, he received hundreds of letters from blacks warning him to remove all nigger references from his upcoming film. The letter writers were concerned because the novel on which the film was based was full of such references. So, too, were early drafts of the film script. Initially Selznick sought to solve the problem by promising that the N-word would not be spoken by any white characters, but once he had 114 Pitfalls in Fighting Nigger been made aware of the intensity of blacks feelings, he resolved to prohibit its use entirely and took pains to publicize his decision. A form letter declared that his studio had been in frequent communication with Mr. [Walter] White of the Society for the Advancement of Colored People, and has accepted his suggestions con- cerning the elimination of the word nigger from our picture. . L In the years that followed, blacks began to win other, similar battles. By the 1940s, sensitivities were suffi- ciently aroused for Joseph Conrads The Nigger of the Narcissus (1897) to be removed from open shelves in school libraries for Marjorie Kinnan Rawlingss The Yearling (1938) to be released in a school edition that omitted two passages...

It then quickly and decisively triumphed over poetry in traditional metres to become a new stylistic orthodoxy.2 In fact, English poets had been writing in versions of free verse for many centuries by the end of the nineteenth century metrical discomfort and some degree of resistance to inherited iambic forms had become practically the norm. As Joseph Phelan puts it, in one of several recent revisionist accounts of late nineteenth-century metrical practice, the movement towards free verse was halting and interrupted rather than teleologically 1 N oteFurther information may have been gathered since this article was prepared for publication.

Hartmans Free Verse An Essay on Prosody (Princeton Princeton University Press, 1980) gives an extended and thoughtful version of this story, which grows out of modernist polemic. Robert Bernard Hass describes free verse as the prosodic change accompanying modernisms other disjunctions of content and structure in (Re)Reading Bergson Frost, Pound, and the Legacy of Modern Poetry, Journal of Modern Literature 29. 1 (2005), 5575 (67). 3 This content downloaded from (cid0)(cid0)(cid0)(cid0)(cid0)(cid0)(cid0)(cid0)(cid0)(cid0)(cid0)(cid0)(cid0)172.59.116.33 on Thu, 26 Jun 2025 021554 UTC(cid0)(cid0)(cid0)(cid0)(cid0)(cid0)(cid0)(cid0)(cid0)(cid0)(cid0)(cid0)(cid0) All use subject to httpsabout.jstor.orgterms [Page 5] 4 How Yeats Learned to Scan straightforward.3 But the old-fashioned story of stylistic rupture is not entirely unfounded, because it was only in the twentieth century that the free verse picked up its full range of polemical and ideological associations.

...clarity was also something that Yeats had to learn. It is achieved by highly active syntax and traditional metres, and also by a pretty close fit between the syntactic unit and the prosodic unit. A relatively high proportion of punctuation marks and phrase boundaries occur at the end of the line, but complete coincidence is avoided Yeats did not want the obviousness of Paters free-verse Mona Lisa, where lines do nothing other than mark boundaries between phrases.84 By keeping the syntactic and the verse unit close, but just slightly off-kilter, Yeats forged a natural style capable, at times, of pointed metrical artifice. By refusing to write free verse he also, ironically, enjoyed a liberty with finite verbs and complete statements that is unique in twentieth-century English poetry. Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock, in Prufrock and Other Observations (London The Egoist Press, 1917). 83 W. H. Auden, The Public v. the Late Mr. William Butler Yeats [1939], in Edward Mendelson ed., W. H.

Auden Selected Poems (London Faber Faber, 1979), 8083 (82). 84 I n Yeatss drafts, we very often find a list of complete phrases running down the page, connected, like the free-verse Mona Lisa, through anaphora see, e.g. the draft for the honey of generation stanza in Among School Children, in Richard J.
