    (Matsuda 1991: 805) The myth of standard language persists because it is
    carefully tended and propagated, with huge, almost universal success, so
    that language, the most fundamental of human social­ ization tools, becomes
    a commodity. This is the core of an ideology of standardization which
    empowers certain individuals and institutions to make these decisions and
    impose .d them on others

    Black Lives Matter is an ideological and political intervention in a world
    where Black lives are systematically and in- tentionally targeted for
    demise. It is an affirmation of Black folks’ contributions to this society,
    our humanity, and our resilience in the face of deadly oppression” (Garza,

    These representations have had adverse social, political, and economic

    artisans and traders from the oppressed race/class group, and oriented

    that contained the seeds of a social revolution that remained an incomplete
    revolution because the “political sphere cannot... impose itself on civil
